You are analyzing an ecological field protocol and a KML map file.

TASK: Match KML features to protocol features. Identify:
1. Feature types mentioned in protocol (e.g., site, transect, plot, subplot, block, district)
2. Which KML features correspond to which protocol feature types
3. Feature hierarchy (parent-child relationships) - infer from protocol structure
4. Any features in KML not mentioned in protocol
5. Any features in protocol not found in KML

Output ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:
{feature_schema}

The protocol PDF and KML file are provided as attachments.
