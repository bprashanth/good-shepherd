# Nursery Voice UX POC Agent Instructions

## Goal
Build a voice UX prototype for the Nursery Frappe app, grounded in the Frappe UX spec.

### Required reading order
1. Repo rules: ../../../../AGENTS.md
2. Project map: ../../../../.agent/rules/project-context.md
3. Nursery Frappe UX spec (primary): ../../frappe/UX.md
4. Optional (if needed): ../../frappe/DESIGN.md and ../../frappe/IMPLEMENTATION.md

### Scope
- Default to implementing new ux/voice prototype code only inside this directory.
- If you need schemas/contracts, check frappe doctypes and APIs. These can be found in the ../../frappe/frappe-bench/apps/nursery/ dir. 

### Output expectations
- Keep the POC lightweight and runnable locally.
