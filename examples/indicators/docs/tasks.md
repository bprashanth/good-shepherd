# Indicator Stage TODOs

- Consider merging `variables_codebook.json` and `variable_catalog.json` into a single artifact (codebook + units + examples) to reduce duplication.
- Evaluate whether the indicator agent needs `variables_codebook.json` once `variable_catalog.json` is canonicalized; likely not required.
